# Codebase Documenter

## Overview
Codebase Documenter is a Python tool designed to help you document and analyze your project by generating a comprehensive file (`project_<timestamp>.txt`). This file contains all your source code, configuration files, and project structure, along with detailed statistics.

### Use Cases

- **Code Sharing**: Easily share your codebase with others.
- **Project Archiving**: Create a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
- **Developer Onboarding**: Quickly onboard new developers by providing a clear view of the project structure.
- **Project Analysis**: Gain insights into your project's complexity and structure through statistics.

***The output file includes:***

- Source code of all Python files in the project
- Content of configuration files (`.cfg`, `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`)
- Content of JSON files (`.json`)
- Content of essential files like `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile`
- A representation of the project's folder structure
- Project statistics (number of files, lines of code, functions, classes, and other interesting stats)

### Features
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Captures source code, configuration files, JSON files, and a folder structure.
- **Detailed Statistics**: Provides insights into the codebase's size and complexity (files, lines of code, functions, classes, TODO comments).
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily modify the script to include/exclude specific file types or directories as needed.

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone CodeBase_Documenter.git
cd CodeBase_Documenter
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**Run the script:**

  ```bash
  python allcode.py [root_dir]
  ``` 



***root_dir (optional):*** Path to the root directory of your project. If not provided, the script defaults to the current working directory.

**Find the output:**
The script will generate a (`project_<timestamp>.txt`) within the output directory in your project's root directory. 

Timestamp in the filename represents the date and time when the file was generated.

The output directory will be created if necessary. 

**Configuration**
The script uses a config.yaml file to manage settings such as ignored directories and recognized file extensions. You can customize these settings to suit your project's needs.
